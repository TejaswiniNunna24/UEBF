        <h1>WEEKLY REPORT</h1>
        <h2>WEEK- 2 (From 20-05-24 to 25-05-24)</h2>
        <h2>Objective of the Activity Done: Utilization Of Electricity by Farmers and Related Issues</h2>
        <h2>Detailed Report:</h2>
            <h3>Day 1:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>>On this day our team visited Rajupalem in the Nellore district and conducted survey.
                <li>>The village is known for its traditional farming practices.</li>
                <li>>We identified area is fertile and well-suited for growing a variety of crops due to the favorable climatic conditions.</li>
                </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 2:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>>We asked them how they use electricity for their purposes.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>>We came to know, some farmers use electricity for drip and sprinkler irrigation.</li>
                <li>And electric threshers to separate grains from the harvested crops, saving time and labor.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 3:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>>We asked them how they use electricity for their purposes.
                <li>>We came to know, some farmers use electricity for drip and sprinkler irrigation.</li>
                <li>>And electric threshers to separate grains from the harvested crops, saving time and labor.</li>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 4:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>>We noticed motors are critical component in modern farming.</li>
            <li>>We questioned them regarding usage of motors.</li>
            <li>>Motors are extensively used to power electric water pumps, which draw water from wells, canals, and tanks to irrigate fields.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 5:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>>We surveyed how often they use electricity for a day.</li>
            <li>>We gathered information is that, electricity is good for one time a day and not for another time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Day 6:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>>We observed mostly that, paddy is the most common growing crop in Rajupalem.</li>
            <li>>For this they use electric water pumps, drip and sprinkler systems in giving most importance to electricity</li>
            <li>>And finally, we submitted this week report to our respected guide.</li>
