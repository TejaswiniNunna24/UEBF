        <h1>WEEKLY REPORT</h1>
        <h2>WEEK- 5 (From 10-06-24 to 15-06-24)</h2>
        <h2>Objective of the Activity Done: Utilization Of Electricity by Farmers and Related Issues</h2>
        <h2>Detailed Report:</h2>
            <h3>Day 1:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <li>>On this day of our survey, we also observed another type of irrigation method called “Sprinkle irrigation”.</li>
                <li>>It is a water sprinkler device used to irrigate landscapes, crops through pipes and sprinklers.</li>
                <li>>Water is pumped through the pipes and distributed by the sprinklers over the irrigation area.</li>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 2:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>>We surveyed about the types of sprinkle irrigation used in different conditions.</li>
            <li>>Centre pivot for large scale agriculture, micro sprinkler for small areas, and lateral pivot for rectangular areas.</li>
                
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 3:</h3>
        <ul>
                <li>>The advantages we came to know are water is uniformly distributed, flexibility in soil, and saves more time and labour cost.</li>
                <li>>Due to these advantages in further this system may increase more and reduce manual working.</li>       
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 4:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>>Including advantages also there are disadvantages using this system.</li>
            <li>>There is water loss, high cost for installation and maintenance, and large energy consumption is required. </li>
                
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 5:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>>We observed the crops grown under this system and started surveying about the crops grown.</li>
            <li>>They grow cereals like wheat, vegetables like carrots, and others.</li>
                
        </ul>
        <h3>Day 6:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As a part of final day of the week-5:</li>
            <li>>At last we asked them about how much electricity is used for this system.</li>
            <li>>Based on the size of the area the usage of electricity is required.</li>
            <li>>On average it consumes 1200 watts per hour and it runs averagely 30-60 min per zone.</li>
                
        </ul>
